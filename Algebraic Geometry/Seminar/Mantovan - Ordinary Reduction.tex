\section{Elliptic Curves}

Let $E / \Q$ be an elliptic curve, let $p$ be a prime of good reduction then $E_p$ is either ordinary or supersingular. There are infinitely many primes of ordinary reduction.

\begin{theorem}[Serre]
The set of primes of ordinary reduction has positive density. After $L / \Q$ finite, the set of ordinary primes has denisty $1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Shimura-Tanayama]
If $E$ has CM by $F / \Q$ then the set of ordinary primes has denity 1/2 ($p$ is ordinary iff $p$ is split in $F / \Q$). 
\end{theorem}
