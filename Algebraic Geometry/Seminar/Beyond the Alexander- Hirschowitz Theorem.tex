\section{Elementary Situation}

Fix $r$ points in general possition $x_1, \dots, x_r \in \P^2$. How many curves of degree $d$ pass through these poitns? Equivalently, compute $n = h^0(\P^2, \struct{}(d)(-x_1 - \cdots - x_r))$. We expect,
\[ n = \max \{ \tfrac{1}{2} (d + 1)(d + 2) - r, 0 \} \]
\begin{proof}
By induction it suffices to show that $X_r$ is not a base point of $|\struct{}(d)(-x_1 - \cdots - x_{r-1})$. Indeed we can pick $x_r \notin C$. 
\end{proof}

What about,
\[ H^0(\P^2, \struct{}(d)(-2 x_1 - \cdots - 2 x_r)) \]
i.e. linear series of degree d curves singular at $x_i$? We expect,
\[ n = \max \{ \tfrac{1}{2} (d + 1)(d + 2) - 3 r, 0 \} \]
There are only two sets of exceptions: $d = 2, r = 2$ and $d = 4$, $r = 5$ in which case we expect $\dim = 0$ but $\dim = 1$ since there is a family of singular conics.

\begin{lemma}
On $\P^n$, suppoose singular general points at $x_1, \dots, x_r$ fail to impose independent conditions on $\struct{}(d)$ then there exists a curve containting $x_1, \dots, x_r$ such that any elment of $| \struct{}(d)|$ singular on the $x_i$ is singular on $C$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the embedding $\P^n \embed \P^N$ defined by $| \struct{}(d)|$. Then sections of $\struct{}(d)$ correspond to hyperplanes of $\P^N$ and $H_d$ is singular at $x_i$ iff $H$ contains $T_{x_i} \P^n$. Then general $x_i$ fail to impose independent conditions iff $\left< T_{x_1} \P^n, \dots, T_{x_r} \P^n \right>$ fails to have the maximum dimension. Consider the $(r-1)$-secant variety of $\P^n \subset \P^N$ defined as follows,
\[ Z_{r-1} = \{ (x_1, \dots, x_r, z) \mid z \in \left< x_1, \dots, x_r \right> \} \subset (\P^n)^r \times \P^N \]
Then consider the projection $\pi : Z_{r - 1} \to \P^N$. We define $\sigma_{r - 1}(\P^n) = \overline{\pi(Z_{r-1})}$. Then $\sigma_{r - 1}(\P^n)$ fials to have the expected dimension iff $\pi$ has positive dimensional fibres. Now take $C$ in a fibre to give the needed curve. 
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
The following is conjectured. Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of $\dim{X} = n$ and $\L$ a (very) ample line bundle. Then for all but finitely many $(r, d)$ for all general $x_1, \dots, x_r \in X$,
\[ h^0(X, \L^{\otimes d}(-2 x_1 - \cdots - 2 x_r)) = \max \{ h^0(\L^{\otimes d}) - (n + 1) r , 0 \} \]
\end{rmk}
