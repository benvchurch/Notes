abstract="The main aim of these lectures is to present the stable reduction theorem with the point of view of Deligne and Mumford. We introduce the basic material needed to manipulate models of curves, including intersection theory on regular arithmetic surfaces, blow-ups and blow-downs, and the structure of the jacobian of a singular curve. The proof of stable reduction in characteristic 0 is given, while the proof in the general case is explained and important parts are proved. We give applications to the moduli of curves and covers of curves.",

    abstract = "{Let \\$C\\$ be an algebraic curve defined by a sufficiently generic bivariate Laurent polynomial with given Newton polygon \\$\\Delta\\$. It is classical that the geometric genus of \\$C\\$ equals the number of lattice points in the interior of \\$\\Delta\\$. In this paper we give similar combinatorial interpretations for the gonality, the Clifford index, and the Clifford dimension, by removing a technical assumption from a recent result of Kawaguchi. More generally, the method shows that apart from certain well-understood exceptions, every base-point free pencil whose degree equals or slightly exceeds the gonality is combinatorial, in the sense that it corresponds to projecting \\$C\\$ along a lattice direction. Along the way we prove various features of combinatorial pencils. For instance, we give an interpretation for the scrollar invariants associated with a combinatorial pencil, and show how one can tell whether the pencil is complete or not. A similar interpretation for its first scrollar Betti numbers (as introduced by Schreyer) is also given. Among the applications, we find that every smooth projective curve admits at most one Weierstrass semi-group of embedding dimension \\$2\\$, and that if a non-hyperelliptic smooth projective curve \\$C\\$ of genus \\$g \\geq 2\\$ can be embedded in the nth Hirzebruch surface \\$\\mathcal\\{H\\}\_n\\$, then \\$n\\$ is actually an invariant of \\$C\\$.This article comes along with three Magma files: basic\_commands.m, gonal.m, neargonal.m}",

@book{Liu,
Abstract = {This book is a general introduction to the theory of schemes, followed by applications to arithmetic surfaces and to the theory of reduction of algebraic curves. The first part introduces basic objects such as schemes, morphisms, base change, local properties (normality, regularity, Zariski's Main Theorem). This is followed by the more global aspect: coherent sheaves and a finiteness theorem for their cohomology groups. Then follows a chapter on sheaves of differentials, dualizing sheaves, and Grothendieck's duality theory. The first part ends with the theorem of Riemann-Roch and its application to the study of smooth projective curves over a field. Singular curves are treated through a detailed study of the Picard group. The second part starts with blowing-ups and desingularisation (embedded or not) of fibered surfaces over a Dedekind ring that leads on to intersection theory on arithmetic surfaces. Castelnuovo's criterion is proved and also the existence of the minimal regular model},
