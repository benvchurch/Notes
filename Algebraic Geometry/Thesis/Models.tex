\section{Regular Rings and Schemes}

\begin{example}
Consider $X = \Spec{k[x]/(x^2)}$. Then consider the unique point $p = (x)$ and $\stalk{X}{p} = (k[x]/(x^2))_{(x)}$. Then $\m_p = (x)$ and thus we have,
\[ \m_p / \m_p^2 = \m_p = k x \]
so $\dim_k \m_p / \m_p^2 = 1$ but $\dim{\stalk{X}{p}} = 0$. 
\end{example}

\section{Normal Crossings Divisors}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian scheme. A \textit{strict normal crossings divisor} on $X$ is an effective Cartier divisor $D \subset X$ such that for each $p \in D$ the local ring $\stalk{X}{p}$ is regular and there exists a regular system of parameters $x_1, \dots, x_d \in \m_p$ and $1 \le r \le d$ sch that $D$ is cut out by $x_1 \cdots x_r \in \stalk{X}{p}$ 
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Consider the closed subscheme of $\A^2_k$,
\[ X = \Spec{k[x, y]/(xy)} \]
Then consider the point $p = (x, y)$ so we need to consider the ring,
\[ \stalk{X}{p} = (k[x, y]/(xy))_{(x, y)} \]
with maximal ideal,
\[ \m_p = (x, y) \]
I claim that this is a regular system of parameters and
\[ \m_p / \m_p^2 = k x \oplus k y \] 
However, $\dim{\stalk{X}{p}} = 1$ since we have the maximal chain of primes $(y) \subset (x, y)$ so $\stalk{X}{p}$ is not regular. However, $X$ is a strict normal crossings divisor of $\A^2_k$ since $X$ is cut out by $xy$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Consider the closed subscheme of $\A^2_k$,
\[ X = \Spec{k[x, y]/(y(x^2 - y))} \]
Then consider the point $p = (x, y)$ so we need to consider the ring,
\[ \stalk{X}{p} = (k[x, y]/(y(x^2 - y)))_{(x, y)} \]
with maximal ideal,
\[ \m_p = (x, y) \]
I claim that this is a regular system of parameters and
\[ \m_p / \m_p^2 = k x \oplus k y \] 
However, $\dim{\stalk{X}{p}} = 1$ since we have the maximal chain of primes $(y) \subset (x, y)$ so $\stalk{X}{p}$ is not regular. Furthermore, $X$ is a strict normal crossings divisor of $\A^2_k$ is not cut out by the products of the regular parameters. 
\end{example}


\section{Introdution}

\begin{remark}
For me a curve is a separated dimension one scheme of finite type over a field $k$. We will be careful to distinguish between smooth and singular curves.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
Proper curves are automatically projective.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
We will generically be in the following situation, let $R$ be a DVR and $K = \Frac{R}$ is field of fractions. Then we will be given a curve $C$ over $K$. 
\bigskip\\
Alternatively, given a field $K$ with a discrete valuation $\nu$ then we may take $R_\nu$ to be the valuation ring which reduces to the previous situation.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Given a smooth curve $C$ over $K$ a \textit{regular model} for $C$ over $R$ is a regular $R$-scheme $X \to \Spec{R}$ such that the generic fibre $X_K = X \times_{\Spec{R}} \Spec{K}$ (the fibre over the generic point $\Spec{K} \to \Spec{R}$) is $K$-isomorphic to $C$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Existence of Regular Models]
If $C$ is a proper smooth curve over $K$ then $C$ admits a regular model over $R$. 
\end{theorem}

\section{Models of Curves}

\begin{remark}
$R$ is a DVR with fraction field $K$ and residue field $\kappa$ and uniformizer $\pi$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[01WS]
Let $X$ be a regular model of a smooth curve $C$ over $K$. Then,
\begin{enumerate}
\item the special fibre $X_\kappa$ is an effective Cartier divisor on $X$,
\item each irreducible component $C-i$ of $X_\kappa$ is an effective Cartier divisor on $X$,
\item as Cartier divisors,
\[ X_\kappa = \sum_i m_i C_i \]
where $m_i$ is the multiplicity of $C_i$ in $X_\kappa$,
\item $\struct{X}(X_\kappa) \cong \struct{X}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $K$ with $H^0(C, \struct{C}) = K$ and $X$ a regular proper model of $C$. Let $C_1, \dots, C_n$ be the irreducible components of the special fibre $X_\kappa$. Then we write,
\[ X_\kappa = \sum_i m_i C_i \]
where $m_i$ is the multiplicity of $C_i$. 
\end{definition}


\subsection{Minmal Models and Uniqueness}

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $K$ with $H^0(C, \struct{C}) = K$. A \textit{minimal model} is a regular, proper model $X$ of $C$ such that $X$ does not contain an exceptional curve of the first kind. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
We call the following an \textit{exceptional curve of the first kind}:
\bigskip\\
Let $X$ be a Noetherian scheme. Let $E \subset X$ be a closed subscheme with the following properties,
\begin{enumerate}
\item $E$ is an effective Cartier divisor on $X$,
\item there exists a field $k$ and an isomorphism $\P^1_k \to E$,
\item the normal sheaf $\mathcal{N}_{E/X}$ pulls back to $\struct{\P^1_k}(-1)$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
In the above situation, the special fibre $X_\kappa$ is connected. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $K$ with $H^0(C, \struct{C}) = K$. If $X$ is a regular proper model for $C$, then there exists a sequence of morphisms,
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X = X_m \arrow[r] & X_{m-1} \arrow[r] & \cdots \arrow[r] & X_1 \arrow[r] & X_0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
of proper regular models of $C$, such that each morphism is a contraction of an exceptional curve of the first kind, and such that $X_0$ is a minimal model.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes and $D \subset X$ an effective Cariter divisor. Then $f : X \to Y$ is a contraction of $D$ if $f$ is proper such that $f(E) = \{ y \}$ for some closed point $y \in Y$ where $\stalk{Y}{y}$ is regular and $\dim{\stalk{Y}{y}} = 2$ and such that $f : X \to Y$ is the blowup of $Y$ at $y$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}[0C5J]
Let $X$ be a Noetherian scheme. Let $E \subset X$ be an exceptional curve of the first kind. If a contraction $f : X \to X'$ of $E$ exists, then it satisfies the following univesal property: for every morphism $\varphi : X \to Y$ such that $\varphi(E)$ is a point, then $\varphi$ factors uniquely through $f : X \to X'$,
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, "f"] & X \arrow[r, "\varphi"] \arrow[d, "f"] & Y
\\
\Spec{\kappa(x')} \arrow[r, hook] & X' \arrow[ru, dashed, "\tilde{\varphi}"']  
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
If it exists, any contraction of $E \subset X$ is unique up to unique isomorphism. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $K$ with $H^0(C, \struct{C}) = K$. A minimal model $X$ of $C$ over $R$ exists.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Choose a closed immersion $C \to \P^n_K$ and let $X$ be the scheme theoretic image of $C \to \P^n_K \to \P^n_R$. Then by some lemmas $X \to \Spec{R}$ is a proejctive model of $C$ and there exists a resolution of singularities $X' \to X$ and $X'$ is a model for $C$. Then $X' \to \Spec{R}$ is proper as a composition of proper morphisms. Then we use the previous result to obtain a minimal model by blowing down.  
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $K$ with $H^0(C, \struct{C}) = K$ and positive genus. The minimal model $X$ of $C$ over $R$ is unique.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $K$ with $H^0(C, \struct{C}) = K$ and positive genus. Let $X$ be the minimal model for $C$ over $R$. Let $Y$ be a regular proper model for $C$. Then there is a unique morphism of model $Y \to X$ which is a sequence of contractions of exceptional curves of the first kind. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
If the curve $C$ has genus zero. Then minimal models are generically nonunique. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The minimal model (proper, regular, no exceptional curves of the first kind, then minimal with respect to these conditions) does not necessarily agree with the minimal regular normal crossings model (proper, regular, strict normal  crossings divisiors in the special fibre, minimal with respect to these conditions). This is because the minimal model may require blowing up to get strict normal crossings. However, the minimal regular normal corssings model gives the minimal model via blowing down. 
\end{remark}

\section{Picard Groups of Curves}

\begin{lemma}[0C63]
There is an exact sequence,
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & \Z^{\oplus n} \arrow[r] & \Pic{X} \arrow[r] & \Pic{C} \arrow[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
sending $1 \mapsto (m_1, \dots, m_n)$ and $e_i \mapsto \struct{X}(C_i)$ 
\end{lemma}

\section{Neron Model}

\begin{definition}
Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain and $K$ its field of fractions such that $\Spec{K} \to \Spec{R}$ is the inclusion of the generic point. Then given a $K$-scheme $X_K$ we say a \textit{model} of $X_K$ over $R$ is an $R$-scheme $f : X \to \Spec{R}$ such that the generic fiber $X \times_R K$ of the structure map $f$ is $K$-isomorphic to $X_K$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $A$ be a smooth separated scheme of finite type over $K$
A Neron model of $A_K$ over $R$ is a model $A$ over $R$ such that for any smooth separated $R$-scheme $X$ we have the following extension property, given a $K$-map $f : X_K \to A_K$ there is a unique extension to $\phi : X \to A_R$ such that $f = \phi \times_R K$.  
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X_K \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & A_K \arrow[d]
\\
X \arrow[r, dashed, "\exists !"] & A_R
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
In particular, take $X = \Spec{R}$ then $X_K = \Spec{K}$ so the $K$-points of $A_K$ give unique $R$-points of $A_R$. Thus $A_K(K) \to A_R(R)$ is an isomorphism since any $R$-point of $A_R$ base changes to a $K$-point of $A_K = A_R \times_R K$ 
\end{definition}
