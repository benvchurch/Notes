\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{defn}
We say a $k$-group $G$ is \textit{algebraic} if it is finite type over $k$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
A connected algebraic $k$-group $G$ is geometrically connected and geometrically irreducible.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
See HW 1 for proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
Over an imperfect field $k$ a reduced connected algebraic $k$-group need not be geometrically reduced (and thus not smooth). For example see W1 Exercise
4(iii).
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}
Any $k$-group scheme is automatically separated.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The map $e : \Spec{k} \to G$ is a closed immersion. Notice that $\Delta_{G/k} : G \to G \times_k G$ is the base change of $e$ via $f = m \circ (\id, \iota) : G \times_k G \to G$ because,
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = large]
G \arrow[rrd, "\Delta_{G/k}", bend left] \arrow[ddr, bend right] \arrow[rd, dashed]
\\
& X \pullback \arrow[d] \arrow[r] & G \times_k G \arrow[d, "f"]
\\
& \Spec{k} \arrow[r, "e"] & G
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
commutes giving an arrow $G \to X$. However, $X \to G \times_k G$ gives a pair of maps $f,g : X \to G$ such that $m \circ (f, \iota \circ g) = e$ then by the group axioms,
\[ g = m \circ (e, g) = m \circ (m \circ (f, \iota \circ g), g) = m \circ (f, m(\iota \circ g, g)) = m \circ (f, e) = f \]
so $f = g$ and thus $(f,g) = \Delta_{G/k} \circ f$ so the universal map factors uniquely through $\Delta_{G/k}$ and thus $G \to X$ is an isomorphism. 
\end{proof}

\section{Smoothness of Algebraic Groups}

\begin{lemma}
Let $A$ be a local Noetherian $k$-algebra with residue field $k$. Let $k'/k$ be a field extension $\m' = \ker{(A \otimes_k k' \to k')}$. Assume that $A' = (A_{k'})_{\m'}$ is Noetherian. Then $A$ is regular if and only if $A'$ is regular.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The map $A \to A'$ is a local map of local Noetherian ring. Furthermore, $k \to k'$ is flat so $A \to A_{k'}$ is flat and thus $A \to A_{k'} \to A'$ is flat because localization is flat. Thus, by the dimension formula,
\[ \dim{A'} = \dim{A} + \dim{A'/\m A'} \]
but $\m A' = \m'$ so $\dim{A'/\m A'} = \dim{k'} = 0$. Thus,
\[ \dim{A'} = \dim{A} \]
Furthermore, by flatness of $k'/k$ we see that $k' \otimes_k \m / \m^2 \iso \m' / \m'^2$ canonically. Thus,
\[ \dim_k \m / \m^2 = \dim_{k'} \m' / \m'^2 \]
Therefore,
\[ \dim{A'} = \dim_{k'} \m' / \m'^2 \iff \dim{A} = \dim_k \m / \m^2 \]
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
This fails for $A = \Q[[x]]$ and $k' = \CC$ because $\m' = \ker{(\Q[[x]] \otimes_{\Q} \CC \onto \CC)}$ is exactly the ideal $(X)$. Notice that if $\alpha \in \CC$ is transcendental then a power series like,
\[ 1 - \alpha x \]
is not in $\m'$ but has no inverse because its inverse,
\[ 1 + \alpha x + \alpha^2 x^2 + \alpha^3 x^3 + \cdots \]
is not in $A_{\CC}$ because it has infinitely many $\Q$-independent coefficients. Thus $A'$ is larger than $A_{\CC}$ and is not Noetherian.
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk}
Consider $k = \FF_p(t)$ and $k' = \FF_p(t^{\frac{1}{p}})$ then let $A = \FF_p[t]/(t^p - 1) \cong \mu_p \cong k'$. Then $A \otimes_k k' = k'[t]/(t^{\frac{1}{p}} - 1)^p$ is non-reduced but local and Noetherian. This fails because the residue field of $A$ is $k'$. It is the rationality of the point $\m$ that saves the day.
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}
Let $G$ be an algebraic $k$-group. Then the following are equivalent,
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ is smooth
\item $G_{\bar{k}}$ is regular
\item $\stalk{G_{\bar{k}}}{e_{\bar{k}}}$ is regular
\item $\stalk{G}{e}$ is regular
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The equivalence of (a) and (b) is general. The equivalence of (b) and (c) comes from translation by $G(\bar{k})$ acting transitively on $G_{\bar{k}}$ and thus if one point is regular then every point is regular since translation is an automorphism. Equivalence of (c) and (d) follow from the lemma. 
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
An algebraic $k$-group is smooth if and only if it is geometrically reduced.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Since $G_{\bar{k}}$ is a reduced finite type $\bar{k}$-scheme, by generic smoothness, it has a smooth point. Therefore, every point is smooth by translation. See the proof of Lemma 3.2.3. for more details.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
Therefore, we can add the condition that $\stalk{G}{e}$ is geometrically reduced to the above list.
\end{rmk}

\begin{cor}
Over a perfect field $k$, an algebraic $k$-group is smooth if and only it it is reduced.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Over a perfect field, any reduced $k$-algebra is geometrically reduced by Tag 030U.
\end{proof}
