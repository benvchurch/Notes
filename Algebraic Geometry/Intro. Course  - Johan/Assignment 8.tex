\section{Problem 1}

Consider the polynomial,
\[ F = X_0^5 + X_1^5 + X_2^5 \]
Now suppose that,
\[ F = \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_i} = 0 \]
simultaneously. Then,
\[ 5 X_0^4 = 5 X_1^4 = 5 X_2^4 = 0 \]
over characteristic zero this implies that $X_0 = X_1 = X_2 = 0$. Thus, if we consider the scheme,
\[ X = \Proj{\Q[X_0, X_1, X_2]/(F)} \]
then $X$ is a curve over $\Q$ of genus,
\[ g = \frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} = 6 \]
because $d = 5$. Furthermore, $X$ is smooth because,
\[ X_{\overline{\Q}} = X \times_{\Spec{\Q}} \Spec{\overline{\Q}} = \Proj{\overline{\Q}[X_0, X_1, X_2]/(F)} \]
is smooth since we need only check this on geometric points as we have already done. Equivalently, consider the ideal,
\[ D = \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_0}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_1}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_2} \right) = (5 X_0^4, 5 X_1^4, 5 X_2^4) \]
Thus as long as the characteristic is not $5$ then $D = (X_0^4, X_1^4, X_2^4)$ and therefore, letting,
\[ I = (F, D) \]
we see that $(X_0, X_1, X_2) \subset \sqrt{I}$ so $I$ is an irrelevant ideal i.e. no relevant primes lie above $I$ so $X$ is smooth since its singular locus is empty. 

\section{Problem 2}

Let $k = \mathbb{F}_2$ and consider the quartic surface in $\P^3_k$ defined by,
\[ F = X_0^4 + X_0 X_1^3 + X_1 X_2^3 + X_2 X_3^3 \]
Consider the derivatives,
\begin{align*}
F_0 = \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_0} & = X_1^3
\\
F_1 = \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_1} & = X_0 X_1^2 + X_2^3
\\
F_2 = \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_2} & = X_1 X_2^2 + X_3^3
\\
F_3 = \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_3} & = X_2 X_3^2
\end{align*}
which are true because the characteristic of $k$ is $2$.
Consider the homogeneous ideal $I = (F, F_0, F_1, F_2, F_3)$. 
Now, $X_1^3 \in I$ and thus $X_1 \in \sqrt{I}$. Furthermore, $F_1 \in \sqrt{I}$ and thus,
\[ X_2^3 = F_1 - X_0 X_1^2 \in \sqrt{I} \implies X_2 \in \sqrt{I} \]
Furthermore, $F_2 \in I$ and thus,
\[ X_3^3 = F_2 - X_1 X_2^2 \in \sqrt{I} \]
Finally
\[ X_0^4 = F - X_1 F_1 - X_3 F_3  \in I \implies X_0 \in \sqrt{I} \]
Therefore,
\[ (X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3) \subset \sqrt{I} \]
and thus $I$ is an irrelevant ideal meaning that $\Proj{k[X_0,X_1,X_2,X_3]/I}$ is empty since every prime above $I$ is irrelevant i.e. contains the ideal $(X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3)$. Thus the variety $\Proj{k[X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3]/(F)}$ is a smooth degree four surface in $\P^3_k$.
