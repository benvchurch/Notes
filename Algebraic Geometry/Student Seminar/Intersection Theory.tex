\section{Introduction}

\renewcommand{\or}{\mathrm{or}}

Assume that $X$ is a connected $n$-dimensional smooth manifold. And $A, B \subset X$ oriented closed submanifolds with $\dim{A} + \dim{B} = \dim{X}$. Assume that $A, B$ intersect transversally menaing,
\[ \forall x \in A \cap B : T_x X = T_x A \oplus T_x B \]
Then we can consider,
\[ [A] \in H_a(A) \to H_a(X) \to H^{n-a}(X) \]
and
\[ [B] \in H_b(B) \to H_b(X) \to H^{n-b}(X) \]
then,
\[ \deg{([A] \smile [B])} = \sum_{x \in A \cap B} \or_x(x, A, B) \]
This requires the orientations. 
\bigskip\\
If $V$ is a $\CC$-vectorspace then $V$ has a canonical orientation. Therefore if $X$ is a complex manifold and $A, B$ are complex submanifolds then,
\[ \or_x(X, A, B) =  1 \]
Therefore, intersection numbers are allways positive. This is very useful. For example:

\begin{prop}
Let $C$ be an integral curve in $\CP^n$ and $[C] = [L]$ for $L$ a line. Then $C$ is a line.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Choose two points on $C$ and consider hyperplane $H$ through those two points. Then,
\[ \deg{([C] \cdot [H])} = 1 \]
becuase $[C] = [L]$. If $H$ is transverse to $C$ then this would be a contradiction. Therefore $H$ is not transverse to $C$. Therefore $C \subset H$. Therefore $C$ is contained in all hyperplanes through those two points and thus $C$ is a line. 
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $X$ be smooth and $Y \subset X$ is smooth and $Z \subset X$ is CM and $Y \cap Z$ is pure of the expected dimension. Then,
\[ [Y] \smile [Z] = \sum_{C \subset Y \cap Z} a_C [C] \]
where $C \subset Y \cap Z$ are components and $a_C > 0$. 
\end{prop}

\subsection{Main Theorems}

Let $X$ be a variety (not necessarily smooth) over $k$ (not necessarily $k = \bar{k}$). Then we define Chow,
\[ A_i(X) = \Z[ \text{prime divisors of dim = } i ] / \text{rational equivalence} \]
Given a proper map $f : X \to Y$ there is a pushforward $f_* : A_i(X) \to A_i(Y)$. If $f : X \to Y$ is flat and $X, Y$ are integral then there is a pullback $f^* : A_{\dim{X}-i}(Y) \to A_{\dim{X}-i}(X)$.
\bigskip\\
Gysin map for an lci map $X \embed Y$ (e.g. a smooth variety embedding in a smooth variety). Then there is a map,
\[ i^! : A_{\dim{Y} - i}(Y) \to A_{\dim{X}-i}(X) \]
In particular, if $X$ is smooth then applying this to the diagonal $\Delta : X \embed X \times X$ this gives,
\[ A(X) \ot A(X) \to A(X \times X) \xrightarrow{i^!} A(X) \]
which is the intersection product.
