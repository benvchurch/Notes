  abstract={The authors derive integral equations for a relativistic system of two particles, interacting via the Coulomb force, from the underlying quantum field theory. Three cases, where particles are charged spinless scalars or spin-1/2 fermions, are considered. They discuss the ground-state solutions of these equations in the perturbative and strong-coupling (high-Z) regime for arbitrary masses and charges of the particles. In the limit where the mass of one of the particles becomes infinite comparison is made with the Dirac-Coulomb and Klein-Gordon-Coulomb equations.}

  abstract={We consider nonlinear-mediating-field generalizations of the Wick–Cutkosky model. Using an iterative approach and eliminating the mediating field by means of the covariant Green's function we arrive at a Lagrangian density containing many-point time-nonlocal interaction terms. In low-order approximations of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phiv.gif] {phiv} 3 + ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phiv.gif] {phiv} 4 theory we obtain the usual two-current interaction as well as a three-current interaction of a confining type. The same result is obtained without approximation for a version of the dipole model. The transition to the Hamiltonian formalism and subsequent canonical quantization is performed with time non-locality taken into account approximately. A relativistic three-particle wave equation is derived variationally by using a three-particle Fock space trial state. The non-relativistic limit of this equation is obtained and its properties are analyzed and discussed.}
