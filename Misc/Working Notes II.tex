\section{Picard Scheme}

\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a proper $k$-scheme. Then $\fPic_{X/k}$ is represented by a lft $k$-scheme. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{rmk}
However, this does not hold for proper flat families in general even for curves. 
\end{rmk}

From here on let $f : X \to S$ be a flat, locally finitely presented, proper morphism where $S = \Spec{R}$ is a DVR. 

\begin{theorem}[8.3.2]
$\fPic_{X/S}$ is represented by an algebraic space if and only if $f$ is cohomologically flat in degree $0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{rmk}
In fact, the above holds when $S$ is any reduced scheme.
\end{rmk}

This is a problem since we want to study non-cohomologically flat situations. We fix this in the next section.

\subsection{Rigidified Picard Scheme}

\begin{prop}[8.1.6]
$f$ admits a rigidifying subscheme meaning a closed subscheme $Y \subset X$ which is flat, locally finitely presented, proper and such that for any $T \to S$ the map,
\[ \Gamma(X_T, \struct{X_T}^\times) \to \Gamma(Y_T, \struct{Y_T}^\times) \]
is injective.  
\end{prop}

\newcommand{\fPic}{\mathrm{Pic}}

\begin{defn}
Let $Y \embed X$ be a rigidifying subscheme. Then we define the rigidified Picard  functor,
\[ \fPic_{X/S|Y} : (T \to S) \mapsto \{ (\L, \varphi) \mid \L \in \Pic{X_T} \text{ and } \varphi : \L|_Y \iso \struct{Y} \} / \cong \]
The condition of being a rigidifying subscheme shows exactly that there are no nontrivial automorphism of $(\L, \varphi)$. 
\end{defn}

FGA shows that the functor,
\[ (T \to S) \mapsto (f_T)_* \struct{X_T} \]
is representable by a linear scheme $V_X$ over $X$. This is a vector bundle over $X$ iff $f$ is cohomologically flat in degree $0$. Furthermore, the subsheaf of units,
\[ (T \to S) \mapsto (f_T)_* \struct{X_T}^\times \]
is represented by an open subscheme,
\[ V_X^\times \subset V_X \]
Now $V_X$ is a ring scheme and $V_X^\times$ is a group scheme. 

\begin{prop}
Let $Y \embed X$ be a rigidifier. 
There is an exact sequence of fppf sheaves of abelian groups,
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & V_X^\times \arrow[r] & V_Y^\times \arrow[r] & \fPic_{X/S} \arrow[r] & \fPic_{X/S|Y} \arrow[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where the last map forgets the rigidification. It is surjective in the fppf topology because by definition any class in $\Pic_{X/S}$ is fppf locally represented by a line bundle.
\end{prop}

\begin{theorem}[8.3.3]
Let $Y \embed X$ be a rigidifier. Then $\fPic_{X/S|Y}$ is representable by an algebraic space over $S$ which admits a universal rigidified line bundle.
\end{theorem}

\begin{prop}
Let $s \in S$ be a point such that $H^2(X_s, \struct{X_s}) = 0$. Then there is an open neighborhood $s \in U \subset S$ such that, both $\fPic_{X/S|Y}|_U$ and $\fPic_{X/S}|_U$ are formally smooth over $U$.
\end{prop}

\subsection{Relative Curves}

Now suppose that $f$ has relative dimension $1$ and has geometrically connected fibers.
