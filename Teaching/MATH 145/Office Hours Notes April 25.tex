\subsection{Elementary Symmetric Polynomials}

Consider the ``root map'' $\Phi : \A^n \to \A^n$ which takes a tuple of roots $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ to the coefficients (up to sign) of the monic polynomial,
\[ (x - \alpha_1) \cdots (x - \alpha_n) \]
which are elementary symmetric polynomials $s_i(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$. We want to show it is the quotient map of the permutation action $S_n \acts \A^n$. Notice that the action of $S_n \acts \A^n$ is not free at points with repeated coefficients which lie above polynomial having repeated roots. Nevertheless, its quotient is actually nonsingular and isomorphic to $\A^n$. This is due to the ``fundamental theorem of elementary symmetric polynomials''. 

\begin{thm}
Let $S_n \acts k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ by permutation. Then,
\[ (k[x_1, \dots, x_n])^{S_n} = k[s_1, \dots, s_n] \]
where the algebra on the right is freely generated by the elementary symmetric polynomials.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The map $\Phi : \A^n \to \A^n$ determined by $A = k[s_1, \dots, s_n] \to k[x_1, \dots, x_n] = B$ which takes a tuple of roots $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ to the coefficients (up to sign) of the monic polynomial,
\[ (x - \alpha_1) \cdots (x - \alpha_n) \]
is dominant because every polynomial has a root in $k = \bar{k}$ and thus $k[s_1, \dots, s_n] \to k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is injective. Now we consider the inclusion of fraction fields,
\[ \Frac{A} = k(s_1, \dots, s_n) \subset k(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \Frac{B} \]
which is the splitting field of the ``universal polynomial'',
\[ X^n - s_1 X^{n-1} + \cdots + (-1)^n s_n = \prod_{i = 1}^n (X - x_i) \]
and hence is Galois with $G \embed S_n$ but clearly the permutation action $S_n \acts \Frac{B}$ is via field automorphisms fixing $\Frac{A}$ so we see that $G = S_n$ so by Galois theory,
\[ \Frac{A} = \Frac{B}^G \]
Then because $A = k[s_1, \dots, s_n]$ is integrally closed,
\[ A^{S_n} = \Frac{B}^{S_n} \cap B = \Frac{A} \cap B = A \]
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
Geometrically this proof is doing the following.  Because the map $\Phi : \A^n \to \A^n$ is $S_n$-invariant it factors as,
\[ \A^n \to \A^n/S_n \to \A^n \]
Using Galois theory we show that $\A^n/S_n \to \A^n$ is generically (meaning on the function fields) an isomorphism (you could also see this geometrically because $S_n$ acts transitively on the fibers of $\Phi$ and thus $\A^n/S_n \to \A^n$ is bijective so it must have ``generic degree $1$'' meaning it is an isomorphism on the function fields) but it is also finite so $\A^n / S_n \to \A^n$ is an isomorphism because $\A^n$ is normal. 
\end{rmk}

\begin{rmk}
Notice that if $f : X \to Y$ is a bijective map of varieties which is generically an isomorphism (meaning is an isomorphism on function fields) it does not follow that $f$ is an isomorphism. For example,
\[ \mathrm{Spc}(k[t]) \to \mathrm{Spc}(k[x,y]/(y^2 - x^3)) \quad \text{ where } \quad x \mapsto t^3 \text{ and } y \mapsto t^2 \]
is an isomorphism on function fields because $t = \frac{x}{y}$ but is not an isomorphism of rings. Therefore, we used that $\A^n$ is normal (meaning the ring $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is integrally closed) crucially in the proof.
